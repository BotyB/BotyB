Hello and welcome. I’m Boty

I’m a curious builder and lifelong learner exploring the intersection of software, hardware, and automation.
My learning journey spans multiple programming languages Java, C, and Python which I use to design and develop both backend systems and hands-on DIY electronics projects.

I’ve completed a Backend Programming Course focused on Java, SQL, and system design, following earlier training in Manual and Automation QA Testing.
With a strong background in mechanical, electrical, and electronic systems, I enjoy bridging theory with practice turning ideas into working prototypes.

Projects & Interests
 - Java backend applications
 - Arduino / Raspberry Pi / ESP32 embedded builds
 - SQL databases & data management
 - Algorithmic problem solving
 - From theoretical design → practical realization

Tools & Technologies
 - IntelliJ IDEA, DataGrip, PyCharm, VS Code
 - PostgreSQL, MySQL, Docker, Postman
 - Git & GitHub, Arduino IDE

Thanks for stopping by and welcome to my workshop of ideas.
