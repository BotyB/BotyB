# 👋 Hello, I'm Boty

🎓 I’m currently enrolled in a Backend Programming Course focused on Java, SQL, and backend system design.  
Previously, I completed a Manual & Automation Testing course and became eager to deepen my skills in Java and software development.

💻 My projects include:
- Java backend applications
- SQL database exercises
- Algorithm challenges

🛠 Tools I use:
- IntelliJ IDEA
- DataGrip (trial)
- Git & GitHub
- VSCode
- PostgreSQL & MySQL
- Postman

🔍 I’m applying for the GitHub Student Developer Pack to support my backend development journey and gain access to JetBrains tools like DataGrip and IntelliJ IDEA.

Thanks for visiting!
